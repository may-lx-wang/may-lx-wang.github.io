My dining hall during sophomore year allowed people to take away one green takeout container worth of food every time we entered, but not any liquids. Therefore I decided to 3D print a water bottle that perfectly fit in the main compartment of the container such that I could take milk every day for protein shakes.
The design had an o-ring grove and was meant to be multi-material and primarily made out of transparent PETG, but after realizing that I could never properly clean in-between the layer lines inside the bottle, I decided not to make it due to food poisoning concerns.
