I've always thought split dyes were a cool hairstyle, but I was thinking of ways to make it even more extra and realized that it would be even funnier at a 45 degree angle. So I decided to make a matlab render of the hairstyle by projecting a vector field onto a head.

(I even oriented the gradient and 'added curl' to better emulate the whorl in my hair)
