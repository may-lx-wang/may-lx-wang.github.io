*Made for CUAUV's '23-'24 submarine*

CUAUV is a completely student run project team that builds an autonomous underwater vehicle every year in order to compete in Robosub's annual event in San Diego. During this year I decided to develop a full stack project, ranging from mechanical design and manufacturing, to schematic and PCB design, to software integration. This ended up being more than I could finish within the year, so the project ended incomplete, but I learned a lot from this experience.

Features include:

- Acrylic tube enclosure with o-ring bore seal and vacuum nozzle
- ESP32 running off of a 18650 battery with power management solutions 
- Wifi <-> Hydroaccoustic DAC and ADC conversion using a piezoelectric ring
- Signal transmission using FSK and custom error correcting protocol
