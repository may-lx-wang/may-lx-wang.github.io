*This research was conducted under post-doc Anand Mishra within Organic Robotics Lab*

Under partnership with the USDA, this soft-robotic worm was developed to monitor the health of plant roots autonomously and non-destructively without the need for physical guidance.  

Features include:
- Modular pneumatic segments that anchored, turned, and moved the worm
- Camera, lighting, and CO2 sensor integration
- Custom redox flow battery using multi-material resin prints

As for my responsibilities within this project, I worked on design tweaks and troubleshooting the worm during demonstrations, but also doing a lot of testing on the forces required for the worm to move. For this process, I helped build a custom soil bulk density testing apparatus, and collected load cell data under varying material, moisture, tip, and velocity conditions.
