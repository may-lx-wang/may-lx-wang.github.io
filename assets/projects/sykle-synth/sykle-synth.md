*Made for IEEE's 2023 SSCS Arduino Competition*
This was a synth + sequencer that I made with the competition's limited part selection, powered off of an Arduino Pro Micro. The largest quirk of the project is definitely the servo, as it was used to display timing data due to the lack of any components with screens.
Features include:
- Custom wood PLA enclosure + laser-cut top panel
- Used MATLAB Stateflow to design an intuitive musical workflow
