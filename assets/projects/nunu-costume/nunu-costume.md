*Made for Halloween 2024*

this is definitely the healthiest way i've ever interfaced with league

Some cool things include:
- Iron on glow in the dark decals
- Fur lining that was extremely messy to attach
- Interesting patterning to make the ears 3 dimensional
- Pendant printed on a holographic plate: It should have been even more shiny but I think the glitter overpowered any iridescence at the end of the day

I also wore this costume way too much during halloweek, but hey it was hype watching T1 BLG in it!
