When I was in 9th grade, I confidently disassembled my garage's failure controller, thinking that I could fix it. I could not at the time. 6 years later, after consistent teasing about this faliure, and as a much more competent engineer, I remade the whole device. Using an mechanical keypad, relay and a QT Py RP2040, it was a pretty quick project. A bodge was made with a BJT transistor as I forgot that my MCU did not have 5V GPIO out, and this was also my first time running multicore sketches (in order to breathe the color of the neopixel as a status indicator).
